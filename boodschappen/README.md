> A Vue.js project

this is a hobby project to learn more about modern web development, apis and other stuff that i'm interested in. 
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
